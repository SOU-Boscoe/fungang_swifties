## Our in class project is writing code that will give you a contrating color to whatever your input it. This will help people pick out color palettes for design projects. 
### We are assigning all colors a number value, and using math we are able to make sure we pair up a color thats 180 degrees opposite of the color wheel. This insures no matter what the input is, as long as its on the standard 12 color wheel it will give you a contrasting color.
